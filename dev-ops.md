## Containers
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Docker container**
  - A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. 
    - code
    - runtime
    - system tools
    - system libraries 
    - settings
  - Container images become containers at runtime
  - Images become containers when they run oin the Docker Engine
  - Containers isolate software from its environment
  - Containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.
- **Containers vs Virtual Machines (VMs)**
  - Similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently
  - Containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware
  - **Containers**
    - Containers are more portable and efficient.
    - Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together
    - Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel, each running isolated processes in user space.
    - Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size)
    - Can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating systems.
  - **Virtual Machines**
    - VMs are an abstraction of a physical hardware turning one server into many servers. 
    - The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine.
    - Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries - taking up tens of GBs.
    - VMs can be slow to boot.
