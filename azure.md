## Security 
- Read this or do the module: 
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/design-for-security-in-azure/2-defense-in-depth
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/design-for-security-in-azure/8-summary
- **Top 5 security items to consider before publishing to production**
  1. Activate Azure Security Center
  2. Validate and verity application inputs and outputs (Mainly User)
    - **Always validate every input for your application**
    - Always use whitelist approach: only accept "known good" input
      - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/web-pages/overview/ui-layouts-and-themes/validating-user-input-in-aspnet-web-pages-sites
      - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet
    - **Always use parameterized queries, do not concat query strings together as this enables SQL injection.**
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-can-i-prevent-sql-injection-in-php
    - **Always encode your ouput to prevent XSS**
      - Any output presented visually or within a document should always be encoded and escaped. (to prevent XSS)
      - In ASP.NET all output is already encoded.
    - Sanitize and validate inputs
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/top-5-security-items-to-consider/3-inputs-and-outputs
  3. Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
    - Storing confidential items like connection strings, security tokens, certificates, and passwords in code is a security risk. 
    - Even storing this data in web config is a bad idea - you allow anyone who has access to source code or web server access to your privdate data. 
  4. Ensure you are using the latest version of your framework and using its security features
    - Awlays use built-in security features, and keep them up to date.
    - Azure Security Center will warn you if your frameworks are out of date as part of recommendations tab.
  5. Verify your program dependencies and libraries are safe to use
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/top-5-security-items-to-consider/6-safe-dependencies
- Azure Security Center
  - Azure Security Center (ASC) is a monitoring service providing thread protection on all your services both in Azure and on-premises.
    - Provides security recommendations
    - Monitors security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads
    - Monitor all services and perform automatic security assessments to potential vulnerabilities
    - Uses Machine learning to block malware from being installed
    - Identify potential inbound attacks 
    - Just-in-time access control for ports, reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic you require.
  - **Activate Azure Security Center**
    - In Azure portal > Security center or Azure security center > Policy and Compliance > Coverage
    - It has free tier and standard tier. 
- **Azure Key Vault**
  - A secret store: centralized cloud service for storing application secrets
  - Keeps confidential data safe by keeping application secrets in a single central location and providing secure access, permissions control, and access logging.
  - Secrets stored in individual vaults, each with own config and security policy. 
  - Can get data through REST API or through a client SDK.
  - Designed to store configuration secrets for server applications NOT for storing data belonging to app's users.

## Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
- **Kubernetes**
  - A standard way to manage application containers in production environment.
- Azure Kubernetes Services brings Azure and Kubernetes together, allowing users to quickly create fully managed Kubernetes clusters.

## Azure vs AWS
- **Azure**
  - PaaS (Platform as a service), IaaS
    - You do not have to maintain VMs yourself (security, service packs etc), just have to maintain your application code.
  - Built-in load balancing abilities
  - .NET written applications moved to the cloud fairly easily.
  - **Compute power**
  - Users choose Virtual Hard Disk (VHD), which is equivalent to a Machine instance, to create a VM. 
    - VHD can be pre-configured.
  - **Storage**
    - Offers temporary storage through D drive, 
    - Block storage: Page Blobs for Vms.
    - Object storage: Block blobs and Files
    - Supports relational databases, NoSql and big Data through Azure Table and HDInsight.
    - Offers site recovery
    - Import/export and azure backup for additional archiving and recovery options.
  - http://www.onlinetech.com/resources/references/aws-vs-azure-key-differences
- **AWS**
  - IaaS
    - Manages the Data, runtime, middleware, operating system, applications.
  - Tools are mostly at a very low level.
  - AWS - Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2): a web service that lets you assign your application to as many "compute units" as desired.
  - **Compute power**
    - Users can configure their own VMs or choose pre-configured machine images (or customise MIs)
    - Users choose size, power, memory capacity, and number of VMs, and choose from different regions and availability zones.
  - **Storage**
    - has temporary storage that is allocated once an instance is started and destroyed when the instance is terminated.
    - Provide block storage (same as hard disks), that can be separate or attached to an instance
    - Object storage is offered with S3
    - Fully supports relational and NoSQL databases and Big Data.
  - Amazon's platform basic advantage is simple: You can just use the amount of storage you want, when you want it.

## Azure
- Enables you to quickly and efficiently build, deploy, monitor and scale cloud hosted solutions. 
- Deployment model is flexible:
  - Can use multiple IDE's to deploy etc.

## Azure App Service
- PaaS - You focus on the build while Azure takes care of the ifnrastructure to run and scale your apps.
- Azure App Service is a fully managed cloud computing platform within the Azure environment that is optimized for hosting web apps, REST APIs, and mobile backends.
  - Supports code written in .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python.
  - Cloud hosting service for your app
- Hosting your web application using Azure App Service makes deploying and managing a web app easier compared to managing a physical server
- **How to host your application on Azure App Service**
  - You can create a web app using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, a script, or an IDE.
  - By creating a web app in the Azure portal, you are creating a set of hosting resources in App Service, which you can use to host any web-based application that is supported by Azure. 
- Good choice for **Stateless microservices**
- **Definitions**
  - Resource group
    - A resource group is a method of grouping interdependent resources and services (i.e. VMs), web apps, DBs, and more for a given application and environment.
    - Think of it as a **folder**, a place to group elements of your app.
    - Allows you to easily manage and delete resources.
    - Enables you to monitor, control, access, provision, and manage billing for collections of resources. 
  - App Service plan
    - Set of physical resources and capacity available to deploy your App service apps into. 
    - Can continue to add apps to an existing plan but they will share the same resource. Overloading an App Service plan can cause reduced performance or downtime for your new and existing apps.
    - **Web apps, mobile apps, azure functions, and API apps hosted in Azure App Service, all run in an App Service plan**
      - You can deploy unlimited number of applications into an App Service plan, the number you use greatly depends on the types of applications deployed.
      - Can use App Service plan to visualise CPU and memory utilization to help determine whether you need to scale or move applications into another App service plan.
    - Region (North Europe, West US etc)
    - Scale count (1, 2, 3 instances etc)
    - Instance size (small, med, large)
    - Pricing tier or SKU (free, shared, basic, standard, prem, premv2, and isolated)
      - Size of the VM that is going to host the application
    - Location
      - This field specifies the region where the App Service plan resides. i.e. where it will setup the VMs
  - Application Insights 
    - Monitoring and metric tools for performance of your apps.
    - Helps detect and diagnose quality issues in your web apps and web services, and helps you understand what your users actually do with it. 
    - Also enables you to view insight reports about traffic
- **Deployment slots**
  -  Add deployment slots to App Serivce web app. e.g. Staging deployment slot, production slot
  - You can easily swap the deployment slots so you can switch from staging to production etc.
  - Deployment slots are actually live apps with their own hostnames. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots
- **Continuous integration/deployment support**
  - Azure portal provides out-of-the-box CI and deployment with the following:
    - Azure DevOps
    - GitHub
    - Bitbucket
    - Dropbox
    - OneDrive
    - or a local git repository on your dev machine.
  - Connect your web app to above, and App service will auto-sync code and any future changes on the code into the web app.
  - With Azure DevOps, you can define your own build and release process that compiles your source code, runs the tests, builds a release, and deploys the release into your web app everytime you commit.
- **Integrated Visual Studio publishing and FTP publishing**
  - Publish your web app to Azure via Web Deploy in Visual Studio or FTP.
  - FTP lacks some capability (better off not using it) 
- **Built-in auto scale support**
  - Can scale up/scale down the web app by increasing/decreasing the resources of the underlying machine that is hosting your web app.
  - Resources can be number of cores or the amount of RAM available.
  - Scaling out, on the other hand, is ability to increase number of machine instances that are running the web app.

## Azure Load Balancer
- Load Balancer distributes new inbound flows that arrive on the Load Balancer's frontend to the backend pool instances, according to rules and health probes.
- Create load-balancing rules to distribute traffic that arrives at frontend to backend pool instances. 
- A public Load Balancer can also provide outbound connections for VM's inside your virtual network by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses.
- Can be public Load Balancer or Internal Load Balancer
- Load Balancer resource's functions expressed as a front end, a rule, a health probe, and a backend pool definition. You place VMs into the backend pool by specifying the backend pool from the VM.
- Benefits
  - Scale applications and create high availability for your services.
  - Supports inbound and outbound scenarios
  - Provides low latency and high throughput
  - Scales up to millions of flows for all TCP and UDP applications.
- **Why use Load Balancer?**
  - No downtime, as if one server (VM) fails, then you can reroute the traffic to the other servers (VMs)
  - Helps with finite resources, as TCP has limited connections, so by load balancing I can balance the traffic on different servers (VMs) and have higher availability. Can scale up and down etc. 
  - Load-balance incoming internet traffic to your VMs. Configuration is known as public load balancer.
  - Load-balance traffic across VMs inside a virtual network. Can also reach a Load Balancer FE from an on-premises network. Configuration is known as a internal load balancer.
  - Port forward traffic to a specific port on a VM.
  - Provide outbound connectivity for VMs inside your virtual network by using a public load balancer.
- Available in two tiers: Basic and Standard.
  - Differences in scale, features, and pricing.
  - Basic Azure Load Balancer is free of charge.
  - Load Balancer is not available with Basic Virtual Machines. 
  - Standard Balancer has prices associated to the number of rules (no charge if no rules are configured) and on the amount of data processed inbound and outbound irrespective of rule. 
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview
- **Concepts**
  - Public Load Balancer
    - Maps public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of the VM, and vice versa for the response traffic from the VM.
    - Applying load-balancing rules enables distribution of specific types of traffic across multiple VMs or services. e.g. spreading load of web request traffic across multiple web servers
    - By default, Azure distributes network traffic equally among multiple VM instances. 
  - Internal Load Balancer
    - Directs traffic only to resources inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure. 
    - Azure infrastructure restricts access to the load-balanced front-end IP addresses of a virtual network. 
    - FE IP addresses and virtual networks are never directly exposed to an internet endpoint.
    - The loadbalancer is only in the virtual network and not exposed to the public

## Create VPN gateway connection from on-premises network to the VNet 
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal

## Azure Virtual Network
- Enables Azure resources such as VM's to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
- Scoped to a single region; however multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected using Virtual Network Peering
- Provides isolation and segmentation
  - Each virtual network is isolated from other virtual networks
  - Specify custom private IP address space using public and private addresses. Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that you assign.
  - Segment the virtual network into one or more subnets and allocate a portion of the virtual network's space to each subnet. 
- Communicate with on-premises resources with the following:
  - Point to site virtual private network (VPN)
  - Site to site VPN
  - Azure ExpressRoute

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment?toc=%2fazure%2fapp-service%2fcontainers%2ftoc.json

## **Azure pipelines**
  - See continous integration tools.md file for description

## Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's properiety globally-distributed, multi-model database service
- Database as a Service
- NoSQL database
  - It is not a relational database and is not good with relational data
  - Not good at JOINS
- Multi-model as in it supports:
  - key-value
  - Document
  - graph
  - Column-family
- By default, you can interact with Cosmos DB using SQL API. All available API's available are:
  - SQL (document)
  - MongoDB (document)
  - Cassandra
  - Azure Table
  - Gemlin (graph)
  - Note: these are just API's that allow you to interact with Cosmos DB.
- This also makes migrating existing MongoDB apps to Cosmos DB easily etc.
- Manages data at planet-scale
- Schema-agnostic
- Azure Cosmos DB provides client-side SDKs for: 
  - .NET, 
  - .NET Core, 
  - Java, 
  - Node.js
  - Python
- Horizontally scales
- **Data model**
  - Stores "items" in "containers"
  - Containers are grouped in "databases", which are same as namespaces.
  - Containers are schema-agnostic, there is no schema when adding items.
  - Every field in each item is automatically indexed.
- **Use case**
  - If your data changes a lot
  - If your data is being ingested at high speed
  - If there lots of data (peta-bytes etc).
  - As long as you do not need JOINS.
- There is a extension for Visual Studio Code you do not have to go to Azure portal to create a DB.
- **Note:** 1000 request units per second (RU/s). 1000 is the minimum RU/s value you can set to enable automatic scaling.

## Azure Service Fabric
- Build and operate always-on, scalable, distributed apps
- **Designed for large and complex microservice systems.**

## Containers
- Docker containers can be hosted in your own Linux or Windows infrastructure
- Docker containers can be hosted in cloud services such as:
  - **Azure Container Service**
    - Can manage, orchestrate, and scale container-based applications in the cloud.

## Serverless Compute 
**Serverless logic**
  - Serverless computing: your cloud provider manages the provisioning and maintenance of the infrastructure letting you focus completely on building the app logic. 
  - Enables you to run pieces of code or functions, written in the programming language of your choice, in the cloud.
- **Serverless compute**
  - Thought of as function as a service (FaaS), or a microservice hosted in the cloud
  - Business logic runs as functions and you don't have to manually provision or scale infrastructure.
  - Cloud provider manages infrastructure
  - App is automatically scaled out or down depending on the load
  - The two most common approaches are:
    - Azure Logic Apps
    - Azure Functions

## Azure Functions (Serverless)
- Azure functions is a serverless application platform. 
- Can host business logic that can be executed without provisioning infrastructure.
- Provides scalability and only charged for the resources used. 
- event driven
- compute-on-demand and scale-based 
- Enables creation of HTTP-based API endpoints accessible by a wide range of applications, mobile, IoT devices etc.
- can implement code that is triggered by events occuring in Azure or third party service as well as on-premises systems.
- Allows developers to take action by connecting to data sources or messaging solutions thus making it easy to process and react to events.
- Basically like a Web API endpoint but it costs money everytime you use it.
- **Note**: If you dev in VS and then deploy it, the function gets compiled and you can't edit it directly in the portal
- **Defintions**
  - What is a Function app?
    - functions are hosted in an execution context called a function app.
    - You define function apps to logically group and structure your functions and compute resource in Azure. 
    - **Must be linked to a storage account**
    - Request parameter name
      - This setting is a string that represents the name of the parameter that contains the information about an incoming HTTP request.
      - By default, the name of the parameter is req.
- **Securing HTTP triggers**
  - By default, it's set to "Function" which requires a API key
    - The scope of the function key is that they are specific to a function
  - It can also be set to "Admin" to use a global "master" key
    - The scope of the Admin/Host key is that they apply to all functions inside the function app.
  - Can be anonymous to indicate no key is required.
  - You can also change the authorization level through the function properties after creation.
  - Since we specified "Function" when we created this function, we will need to supply the key when we send the HTTP request. 
    - You can send it as a query string parameter named code, or as an HTTP header (preferred) named x-functions-key.
  - Functions can integrate with other services, like Event Grid, GitHub, Twilio, Microsoft Graph, and Logic Apps to create complex and robust serverless workflows quickly and easily.
- Plans
  - **Consumption plan (Serverless)**
    - Used when using Azure serverless application platform.
    - Provides automatic scaling and bills you when your functions are running
    - Comes with default config timeout period of 5 mins, up to 10 mins.
  - **Azure App Service plan (Not serverless)**
    - Avoids timeout periods by having functions run continously on a VM
    - Responsible for managing the app resources the function runs on
- **Test your Azure function** 
  - Manual execution
    - If HTTP trigger, you can use Postman or cURL to initiate an HTTP request, which is available from the HTTP trigger definition (Get function URL)
  - Testing in the Azure portal
    - Test > Run in Azure Portal
- **Benefits**
  - Hosts business logic code in the cloud
  - Automatic scaling
  - No servers to maintain or manage, also avoids over-allocation of infrastructure
  - Only changed for what you use - not on reserved time.
  - **Functions**
    - Stateless logic: function instances are created and destroyed on demand. If state is required, it can be stored in associated storage service.
    - Event driven: they run only in response to an event.
    - Functions can be used in traditional compute environments.
- **Triggers**
  - Azure Functions supports triggers which are used to determine how an Azure function is executed.
  - Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions.
  - **Timer trigger**
    - Executes a function at a consistent interval.
    - To create one you need two pieces of information:
      1. A Timestamp parameter name, which is a identifier to access the trigger in code
      2. A Schedule, which is a CRON expression that sets the interval for the timer.
        - CRON expression: {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/3-timer-trigger
  - **Blob trigger**
    - Executes a function when a file is uploaded or updated in Azure blob storage.
    - To create a blob trigger, create an Azure Storage account and provide a location that the trigger monitors.
    - You provide the path of the container that the trigger monitors.
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/7-blob-trigger
- **Bindings**
  - A binding is a connection to data within your function.
  - Makes it easier to integrate with data streams consistently in a function.
  - They are optional and come in form of input and output bindings.
  - An input binding is the data your function receives.
  - An output binding is the data your function sends
  - Unlike a trigger, a function can have multiple input and output bindings
  - You can have multiple bindings providing access to different data elements. This is powerful because you can connect to your data sources without having to code specific connection logic (like database connections or web API interfaces).
  - **Binding properties**
    - Name
      - Defines the function parameter through which you access the data.
      - The name of the function parameter that receives the queue message content.
    - Type
      - type of data or service to interact with
    - Direction
      - input or output binding
    - Connection
      - Provides the name of an app setting key that contains the connection string.
      - Bindings use connection strings stored in app settings to keep secrets out of the function code. 
  - **Binding Expressions**
    - Binding expressions can be done using curly braces i.e. {id} or {name}.png etc
    - It enables you to bind to specific inputs

  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/2-explore-input-and-output-binding-types-portal-lesson
- **Drawbacks of serverless compute solution**
  - Execution time
    - by default, functions have a timeout of 5 minutes, the max is 10 mins. If requires more, then can host on VM. Durable functions also exist to allow you to orchestrate the executions of multiple functions without any timeout.
  - Exceution frequency
    - If you expect your function to be executed continuously by multiple clients, it would be prudent to estimate the usage and caculate the cost of using functions accordingly. It might be cheaper to host on a VM.
    - While scaling, only 1 function app instance can be created every 10 seconds, for up to 200 total instances. 
- **Serverless APIs using Azure Functions**
  - **Azure Functions Proxies (Azure Proxies)**
    - You can use a proxy as a reverse proxy (front end app) where the frontend will request URL's from the proxy and the proxy will redirect those URLs to backend services. You can unify different APIs with this approach making it seem like they all come from the one API. 
    - Can use this 
    - Allows you to forward requests to other resources.
    - You define HTTP endpoint just like with HTTP trigger, then you provide a URL to a remote implementation
    - Allows to compose multiple API sources into a single API surface
    - Useful for building your API as microservices
    - You can use these proxies to break a large API into multiple function apps (as in a microservice architecture), while still presenting a single API surface for clients.
    - Create a serverless-api: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-serverless-api
      - Creates a reverse proxy that is a frontend proxy which redirects calls to the backend function app
      - You can use the reverse proxy to redirect calls to a Mock API implementation. This allows client development to progress, without needing the backend fully implemented. 
        - Later in development, you could create a new function app which supports this logic and redirect your proxy to it.
    - Proxy Request and Response overrides
      - Request and response overrides can also be used in conjunction with a backend URL. This is particularly useful when proxying to a legacy system, where you might need to modify headers, query parameters, etc. 
    - A proxy can point to any HTTP resource, such as:
      - Azure Functions
      - API apps in Azure App Service
      - Docker containers in App Service in Linux
      - Any other hosted API
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/functions-proxies
- **Summary **
  - **Azure functions is code is being triggered by an event**
  - Can be developed and debugged on local workstation, which is a big plus to increase developer productivity
  - When dealing with synchronous request/response calls, that execute more complex logic, Azure function is the preferred option
- **Supports**
  - Continous deployment and integration
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment
  - Intuitive browser-based user interface allowing you to create scheduled or triggered pioeces of code implemented in a variety of programming languages.
- Data processed by Azure Functions can persist into Azure data services such as Azure storage, Azure SQL DB, and Document DB.

- The size of a single message can be as much as 64KB
- Queue can contain millions of messages (up to total cap of storage account)

## Azure Active Directory (AD)
- Can use for storing user identities and doing authentication and authorization.
- Azure AD is a modern identity provider that supports multiple authentication protocols to secure applications and services in the cloud.
  - Users, applications, and other entities registered in Azure AD aren't all lumped into a single global service.
  - Instead, Azure AD is partitioned into separate tenants.
  - A tenant is a dedicated, isolated instance of the Azure AD servicve, owned and managed by an organization.
  - When you sign up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription such as Microsoft Azure or Office 365, a dedicated instance of Azure AD is automatically created for your organization.
- Azure AD is not the same as Windows Active Directory. Windows Active Directory is focused on securing Windows desktops and servers. In contrast, Azure AD is all about web-based authentication standards such as OpenID and OAuth.
- Can take avantage of Azure Key Vault to store your application secrets. 
- Managed Service Identity for Azure couples your app to Azure Active Directory and injects credentials into your application without having to store them in your config files or anywhere else.

## Azure DevOps
- VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services) were renamed to Azure DevOps
- Azure DevOps is a suite of services providing end-to-end solutions for organisations looking for an enterprise-grade toolchain.
- **Services available:**
  - Azure Boards (agile tools to plan, and track)
  - Azure Pipelines (build, test, deploy with CI/CD)
  - Azure Repos (unlimited, cloud-hosted private and public git repos)
  - Azure Test Plans (ship by providing manual and exploratory testing tools)
  - Azure Artifacts (create, host, share packages with your team. Can easily add artifacts to your CI/CD pipelines with a single click)
- helps in releasing higher quality, well tested apps, on a shorter release cycle.
- Having a streamlined development and deployment strategy can:
  - Reduce delays in deliverying features and avoid cost overruns
  - Allow teams to be more efficient with limited resources
  - Generate detailed and accurate performance metrics
- DevOps: is the union of people, process, and products to enable continous delivery of value to our end users. DevOps eliminates Development and Operation working in silos. It creates multidisciplinary teams taht work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Some practices found in DevOps organizations include the following:
  - Agile planning
  - Continous Integration
  - Continous Delivery
  - Monitoring

## Azure Event Grid
- you can use Azure Event Grid with your logic apps for event monitoring, routing, and publishing.
- For serverless application architectures
  - Connects data sources and event handles. e.g. use Event Grid to instantly trigger serverless function to run image analysis each time a new photo is added to a blob storage container.

## Azure Logic Apps (Serverless)
- Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps automate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.
- Simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions for integration, whether in the cloud or on premises.
- Learn how to create, design, and deploy logic apps that automate business processes.
- You can choose from over 200+ connectors, including Azure Service Bus, Functions, Storage, etc.
- Logic apps run only in the cloud, as it has dependency on Microsoft managed connectors. Cannot debug, test or run Logic apps locally
- Create a resource > Select Integration > Logic App.
- **How it works**
  - Every Logic App starts with a trigger
  - Enables you to create Work flows...
  - Each time trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a logic app instance that runs the actions in the workflow
  - Can include conditions statements, switch statements, loops, branching etc.
  - Build in Azure portal, or Visual Studio using the Logic Apps Designer.
    - For custom logic apps, can use JSON in the code view editor.
    - Can also use Azure PowerShell commands and Azure Resource Manager templates for select tasks
  - Logic apps deploy and run in the cloud on Azure
- **Why use Logic Apps**
  - Help connect legacy, modern and cutting-edge systems more quickly by providing prebuilt APIs.
  - You can focus on apps business logic and functionality
  - Don't worry about building, hosting, scaling, managing, maintaining, and monitoring your apps.
  - Pay for only what you use based on consumption pricing model.
  - Can write code in Azure functions and run that code on-demand from logic apps
    - Services automatically scale to meet your needs, make integrations faster, and help build robust coud apps.
  - if your logic apps need to interact with events from Azure services, custom apps, or other solutions, you can use Azure Event Grid with your logic apps for event monitoring, routing, and publishing.
- **Microsoft Flow vs Logic Apps**
  - Microsoft Flow is built on top of logic apps
  - Microsoft Flow is meant for end users to automate bits of their work while logic apps are meant for mission-critical work that is setup by developers.
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs
- **Connectors**
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list
- **Custom connectors**
  - A custom connector is a wrapper around a REST API (Logic Apps also support SOAP APIs) that lets an underlying service talk to Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, or PowerApps. 
    - So first, you need a fully functioning API before you create a custom connector.
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/connectors/custom-connectors/
- **Summary**
  - **Logic apps is a work flow triggered by an event**
    - Logic apps run only in the cloud, as it has dependency on Microsoft managed connectors. Cannot debug, test or run Logic apps locally
  - Logic apps better suited for asynchronous integration and fire-and-forget messaging that requires reliable processing.

## Azure API Management service (APIM)
- Azure API Management helps organisations publish APIs to developers
- Provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection.
- APIM enables you to create and manage modern API gateways for existing backend services hosted anywhere.
- **References**
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- The deployment and management service for Azure.
- Provides consistent management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription.
- When you take actions through the portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI etc, the Azure Resource Manager API handles your request because all requests are handled through the same API. 
- **Benefits**
  - Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources of your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
  - You can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
  - Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts
  - Define dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order
  - Apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based access control is natively intergrated
  - Apply tags to resources to organize all resources 
  - Clarify organisations billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.
